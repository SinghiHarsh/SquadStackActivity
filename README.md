# Parkinglot Application
#### The entire application is written in C++, using the STL commands for data handling and manipulation along with file systems for handling input & output.

#### Following are the instructions required to run the application.

## Setting Up Environment:
### Install minGW compiler 

##### For Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install -y mingw-w64
##### For MacOS: There is no MinGW for macOS. You need to install Xcode from the Mac App Store instead. Once it's installed start it, and allow it to install the command line tools. Finally, test that clang (the compiler on macOS) works in a terminal.
